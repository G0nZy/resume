                                    <div class="paraContainer">Hey, my name is Frank Cabrera & I am studying to become apart of a team specifically in the 
                                        XR space. Ever since getting a VR headset & seeing the worlds VR can transport you to, I have become obsessed with this new technology. 
                                        I have spent most of my life working in Sales but have always loved technology, whether it be building my first pc, or being 
                                        the first to hop on new trends in the space. I have always kept a keen eye out for developing technologies & the application those technologies
                                        have on the real world.
                                        <hr id="spacers">
                                        A little about what I like to do. I love to draw & drawing is something that I do to get my mind straight & keep my thoughts organized.
                                        <img src="./img/hero.png" id="samplePic">
                                        <hr id="spacers">
                                        As you can probably tell from the image above, I am no proffessional but it is something I like to do. I take alot of my 
                                        inspiration from the legend of zelda, star wars & the lord of the rings. I like the heroes journey & overcoming obstacles.
                                        I would like to think in my future I would help develop new mixed reality environments that aid in everyday life. Whether that be 
                                        an escape to a virtual world or an augmented reality experience that aids in everyday life. I believe that these technologies should
                                        be the focus of many companies for years to come. While alot of it is still in the baby stages. This is when these new techs need to 
                                        be nurtured to grow & gain mass adoption.

                                        Now as for code, I have been coding since I was in High School, I used to take an intro to Java class in Highschool but after seeing 
                                        little application for the Java language & not understanding fully the different types of languages and the application of those languages I 
                                        waned off from coding for a bit & focused more on sales. I exceled at selling in both retail & corporate environments & realized 
                                        that many people in these positions didnt understand technical applications. After teaching people how to use MyTeams or navigate Slack
                                        I realized that my true calling was helping develop these technologies so they are more understandable not just to the consumer, but the 
                                        people using those applications to sell aswell.
                                        <hr id="spacers">
                                        I enrolled in a UPenn intro to web dev class & fell back in love with coding. Now more mature & having  an understanding of how these technologies
                                        should be interacting with the real world person I gained a passion for building consumer facing applications. So that is where I currently am,
                                         Trying to develop consumer facing applications & building great products people love using. Nothing is worse than a site, app, piece of software that
                                         is clunky & hard to use. I encourage you to check out my portfolio & <a href="./index.html">leave a comment </a>. I am always open to any 
                                         form of criticism.
