                    <div class="paraContainer"> What Happened to the early web. When I was a little kid using the internet
                            I remember the crazy amounts of customization the early web gave its users. 
                        We used to be able to edit the web contents to our liking without needing approval. Now I am not naive. I get it,
                        the internet today is not only much more complicated, but also mobile! what used to require a desktop, an internet connection
                        & your full focus, now merely requires a smartphone with an app store. Its safe to say that the app store killed the web.
                        Now, will this be permanent or will this be a time thing, im not sure. But what can be said is that apps do offer more control
                        over the user experience as opposed to a webpage. But what is missing in the app experience is the freedom to navigate to other
                        webpages. The whole point of the "In App Experience" is that it is a controlled environment. A walled garden. Now listen, 
                        I love flowers & I love Apples. Im not opposed to building controlled ecosystems. But closing in & out of apps is such a hassle.
                        I imagine a future where apps "communicate" with each other effortlessly. What this looks like im not sure, but what I do know
                        is that the current app system is not only stifling competition, but also innovation. These apps are getting better & more optimized,
                        but that cross app communication is missing.

                <img src="./img/oldInternet.png"  id="oldInternetImg" > <hr><center>take the above image for example</center> 
                        <hr id="spacers">By appreciating what made the early internet so great, we can furhter plan for the future. To recapture
                this magic that was the early web, there is hidden an easter egg on my site. If you navigate back to the home page 
        & click on the image that has the boy with glasses, it will transport you to a early 90s webpage that was built by me as a 
homage to what the early web looked like.</div>
